# Projects from Cousera course 'Algorithm, part I',created by Princeton University.

I programmed 4 projects when I did self-learning on the 'Algorithm, part I' course from Cousera.

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations.

| Project Name | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Percolation System | Built a computational model to estimate the percolation threshold using union-find algorithm |
| CollinearPoints | Implemented an efficient, sorting-based algorithm to find every line segment that connects a subset of 4 or more of the points in the plane |
| 8-PuzzleSolver | Developed a solution to the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm
| KdTree |  Designed a data type to represent a set of points in a unit square using 2d-tree to support efficient range search and nearest neighbor search
